# Pascal's Triangle

A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row.

## Formula for Calculating Pascal's Triangle

The formula to calculate the value of an entry in Pascal's triangle is given by the binomial coefficient formula:

C(n,k) = n! / k!(nâˆ’k)!

Where:

n is the row number (starting from 0).
k is the position in the row (starting from 0).
n! denotes the factorial of 
n, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
